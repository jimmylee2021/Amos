              <h1>Background</h1>
              <p>Patricia OTC is a premium product for over-the-counter crypto trading. The product aims to fast-track the onboarding of premium users whose transactions might be limited by the Patricia app‚Äôs transaction cap.
                It also makes large volume crypto transactions faster as every OTC user is assigned a team of agents.
                To attract and retain the right audience, a landing page that introduces users to the product 
                and its benefits is needed.</p>

              <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
              <p>Patricia OTC is a premium product for over-the-counter crypto trading. The product aims to fast-track the onboarding of premium users whose transactions might be limited by the Patricia app‚Äôs transaction cap.
                Understanding that we are trying to attract and convert users with many options to choose from, I researched top Crypto exchanges that offer OTC.
                I studied the following brands as they are the closest in operations with Patricia;
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pro-bx">
                <p><span style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Binance:</span> Simple content and signing up for the service are obvious.<br>
                    <span style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Kraken:</span> Content is straightforward and includes OTC in major headlines but how to sign up for the product is not obvious on the page.<br>
                    <span style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Major Note:</span> Both brands use OTC in their headlines and simplified content enough for even newbies to understand.</p>

                 <h1>User Personas</h1>

                <p>Understanding that the target users are a mix of corporate and non-corporate users, I tried to maintain a semi-formal tone with the copies while also addressing their user needs.</p>

                <h1>Content Design</h1>
                <p>After studying the user personas and understanding what the users‚Äô pain points and motivations are; I began designing content for the website in collaboration with the UI Designer. We agreed on the page‚Äôs information architecture to ensure that we are both on the same page in terms of content.
                    I used Notion to draft the copies and shared them with the UI Designer. I ensured that the copies are clear by choosing everyday words over Crypto jargon.</p>

                <p>Above are screenshots from the copy canvas I created on Notion for the project. The canvas was reviewed by my Product Manager and also shared with management to ensure that the product‚Äôs USPs are captured in the content design and the product is adequately represented.</p>

                <h1>Designing the Site‚Äôs USPs</h1>
                <p>I included the benefits users will get from the OTC desk when they use the service instead of our competitors.</p>

                <h1>Content Testing</h1>
                <p>To determine if the copies work or not, we A/B tested two variations of the content. Design A had ‚ÄúCrypto OTC‚Äù as the main word while Design B had ‚ÄúCrypto BDC‚Äù as the main word. Out of the 15 respondents, 11 went with Design A citing the following as their reasons; </p>
                <li style="list-style: number;"> It had simpler words, </li>
                <li style="list-style: number;">They are more familiar with OTC than BDC from interacting with competitor‚Äôs websites. 
                It was discovered also that Crypto OTC has a better SEO ranking.</li>  
                 <br><br><br>
                <p> Armed with this data, I ensured that the headlines too included ‚ÄúCrypto OTC‚Äù as that is the phrase most users will use to search for the service when they need the service. I also treated the landing page as an onboarding screen for the web by including values users will get from signing up for OTC.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="pro-bx">
                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>The OTC Marketing and Business Development team witnessed an increase in the number of leads generated through the website since the creation of the OTC landing page. The OTC team is still gathering insights from the website and I hope to use these insights to improve content on the site.</p>
