                 <p>
                    My passion for making digital products easy to use is influenced by the UX problems I faced while using many crypto apps as a newbie in the crypto space. The frustrations of unclear copies and complex interfaces led me to UX Writing.
                    <br><br>
                    I have since used research, information architecture, and words to improve the user experiences of products like Sanwo.io and Patricia. Transitioning from Brand Design into Content Design, my background in the former helps me a lot in the areas of research, understanding the problem, and voice and tone design.

                    <h1>My Process</h1>
                    <p>My process involves spending time understanding the problem, speaking to stakeholders, and prioritising information received from users to make better design decisions that will help the users interact with the product better and also allows the business to achieve its ROI. 
                     <br><br>
                    Also, my efficiency in the use of Figma makes collaboration with UI Designers easy and fast.</p>

                    <p>
                    I belong to various UX Writing and Design communities that are aimed at improving Design like Asa Coterie, UX Writing Africa and Content Design NG. I curate UX Writing resources for people who are just transitioning into the field and sharing knowledge. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside UX Writing work, I design graphics for brands, cook, write poetry and prepare myself to become husband to my future wife and a great father to my unborn kids.
