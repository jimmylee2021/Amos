                <h1>The Background</h1>
                <p>Patricia Universe is a crypto exchange app by Patricia Technologies that gives users the opportunity to buy crypto assets for as low as $1.
                </p>

                <h1>The problem</h1>
                <p>Patricia is growing and the organisation needs a new app that can scale globally and has a¬† more user-friendly experience. The content also needed to be revamped to cater to the new app's offerings.

                <h1>UX Research</h1>
                <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
                <p>In collaboration with the UX Researcher, I conducted preliminary research by asking users to fill out a survey form where we got insights into aspects of the old app that were working and the ones that needed upgrades.¬†
                    <br><br>   
                For instance, there was a debate within the team about whether we should continue to address our users as ‚ÄúChief‚Äù or call them by their first names. Data from our survey indicates that most of our users don‚Äôt mind being called chief.
                 <br><br>   
                Another useful insight from our survey was that 32% of users who responded didn‚Äôt find the old app content useful.

                <h1>Insights from the Relations Team & Conversation Mining</h1>
                <p>
                    I spoke with the Relations Team about common problems that users complain about and also monitored some of the complaints for conversation mining.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Additionally, I reviewed our social media platforms to see the kind of words users use when communicating with the brand.¬†
                    <br><br><br>
                    Armed with this data and other insights from the survey, the team started work on the design.

                    I used insights from the survey to design copy for the product on Figma. Below are some flows from the project.

                <h1>Data Migration</h1>
                <p>
                    To move users from the old app to the new app, we designed a data migration flow.

                <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
                <p>We conducted a usability test for the mobile and web app and discovered the following;</p>
                <li>The content is simple and useful for most users.</li>
                <li>The content on the 2FA screen was a bit complex for users who tested. They weren‚Äôt sure of how to set up 2FA.</li>
                <p>I collaborated with the UX Researcher and UI Designer to redesign the content of the 2FA set-up screen.
