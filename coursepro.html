                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>CoursePro is an online education platform for busy professionals to learn at their own pace. The platform also allows course creators to upload their courses and earn money.
                 <br><br>
                I was tasked with redesigning the content on this page and improving the microcopies especially.
                My first action was to review old content to determine which needs an improvement or not. I then researched competitors like Domestika, Coursera and Udemy. I discovered that although these brands were creative with their copies, they were very concise with the copies and ambiguous copies like "get started" were absent.
                I also realised that Course Pro has a lot of grammatical and punctuation mistakes all of which I corrected in the content redesign.
                I redesigned the copies with the intention to solve the highlighted problems in mind. I have also included notes on the reason for my word choices and other actions.</p>
              </div>
               <div class="pro-bx">
                <h1>Hero section</h1>
                <div class="course-bx">
                    <div class="cou-div">
                        <img src="img/Rectangle 37.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <p>Old copy</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cou-div">
                        <img src="img/Rectangle 38.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <p>New copy</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The current headline copy is vague and lacks the appropriate punctuations.
                    Like the headline, the body copy too is vague, has capitalisation problems and also has some grammatically incorrect phrases.</p>

                    <p>Having gone through the website to understand the products the brand offers (creative courses basically), I opted for a short and clear copy that sells the brand‚Äôs USP.
                        Course Pro‚Äôs USP is giving people the freedom to learn at their own pace and from any device which is now strategically rewritten as ‚Äúon your own terms‚Äù.
                        
                        Rather than a generic ‚Äúget started‚Äù phrase as CTA, I chose ‚ÄúStart learning‚Äù because it is the primary action that the user will be taking once they sign n or sign up.
                        It is also direct to the point and doesn‚Äôt give room for confusion.
                        
                        </p>
               </div>
               <div class="pro-bx">
                <h1>Popular Courses section</h1>
                <div class="course-bx">
                    <div class="cou-div">
                        <img src="img/Rectangle 40.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <p>Old copy</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="cou-div">
                        <img src="img/Rectangle 39.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <p>New copy</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Adding a verb phrase before the current copy will motivate users to click on the popular   courses.</p>

                    <p>The ‚Äústudent‚Äù copy is also grammatically incorrect because the phrase isn‚Äôt referring to just one student so I changed it to a plural form.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="pro-bx">
                <h1>Top Earners</h1>
                <div class="course-bx">
                    <div class="cou-div">
                        <img src="img/Rectangle 42.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <p>Old copy</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The headline here too is vague and doesn‚Äôt explicitly state what tutors get from signing up on Course Pro.
                    The copy was rewritten to inform users what they gain from signing up as tutors and a call to action button is added beside the copy to make the sign up process easy for users.</p>
                    
                   <p>Lastly, names and profession of the top earners are added to let new users run a background check if they wish and further improve the brand‚Äôs equity as a brand creative course creators can partner with.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <p>The headline copy on the website is grammatically incorrect and doesn‚Äôt represent the credibility of Course Pro as a learning platform appropriately.</p>

                <p> I opted for the new copy because it summarises the important message users are meant to get. 
                    Everyone loves discounts and freebies, adding the discount is expected to motivate users to refer their friends.</p>
                
                <p>The body copies are crafted in simple words to avoid confusion for users.</p>

                <p>The old headline sounds robotic. I removed the sub-headline before the form also to allow the user focus on the most important task; contacting Course Pro. I also used this section to add a little humour to the website content with the sub-headline below ‚ÄúHave questions...‚Äù<br>
                    Terms and Conditions was also wrongly written on the website so I changed it.
